Just comment out what you don't need!

Also, you can give options for random field:\
`const myField = new Field(Field.generateField(10,10, 30));`

.generateField method takes 3 parameters:\
first - for height\
second - for width\
third - for how much holes you want (in % of the whole field)

## Gameplay

About the icons:\
'^' - it's a hat\
'0' - it's a hole\
'â–‘' - it's a plain field (you can step on it)\
'*' - this is you (actually it's a path of your moves)

So, you will be promted to input your next move:\
u (up) / r (right) / d (down) / l (left)\
Just type u/r/d/l and push enter, the field will be updated with you move
